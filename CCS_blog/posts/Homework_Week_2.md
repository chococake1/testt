# Homework Week 2

## Double Never

The artwork I decided to choose from Rafaël Rozendaal was his 2017 work, ‘double never, an abstract blue spiky shape, its points moving inwards and outwards continuously. Rozendaal was able to achieve this effect by having several vertexes move between two points.

**Reflection**
I was not able to finish this week’s work, I couldn’t find an easy way to make points move between one another that would not take a long time.
In reflection I probably should have chosen something easier or something I knew I could have done or done faster as I happened to be busy this week. I also originally chose something harder, but after messing around with it for a while, I decided it was too tough for me
