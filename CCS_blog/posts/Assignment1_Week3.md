#Week 3
Cuteness as I understand according to Sianne Ngai is built up of many components, the easily consumable and understandable. It is utopian in the fact it is straight up and easily handled. Its’ powerlessness evokes sadism or care, people want to keep that purity. Ngai states that ‘cuteness reeks of manipulation’ which I only really see to a certain extent

The art I chose belonging to the aesthetic category of cute is Rozendaal’s, ‘www.returnreverse.com’. Rozendaal achieves this with colours and patterns which are easy on the eyes, easy to digest and understand. Colours ease into different hues, no sharp sudden changes in tone keep it predictable. The complexity is in the movement, but that complexity is still very predictable and digestible.

I very much like the circles of different colours, but I would need to change/add a lot of my own ideas and implementing what I learnt toto fulfill the rubric. 
I chose to make my work interactable, depending on where the user clicks, it creates a square, and colours the circle. Clicking again will create another square and the circle will change, remembering the last 10 circle colours. Once the screen fills up with squares, they will all disappear.

I will use bright colours; users control what colours appear and is mostly predictable, most of what happens on the screen is entirely controllable by the user. With the way the circle in the centre works, it makes a ripple like pattern when the user decides to click fast.
